##Problem:
A ‘typical’ restaurant journey is supported by a number of staff – servers, hosts, bartenders, bussers etc; but we as customers interact directly with a subset of these players – servers and bartenders. The other players who have worked hard to give you a great dining experience also earn a share of your direct gratuity. There are no specific industry guidelines around what portion of your gratuity these support staff should receive, but there are normative ranges. For example, the pool of bussers usually get about two percent of the total sales from the servers and bartenders. The bussers (and other similar staff) then split up this two percent amongst themselves using manual calculations at the end of every shift based on the amount of time they worked in that shift.

The ‘checkout process’ is when employees at the end of their shift distribute their accumulated tips to other employees who worked with them throughout the day. While most restaurants have guidelines or house rules for tip out percentages, many restaurants leave the nightly calculations up to the servers and bartenders (most managers and bookkeepers do not have the time to do this regularly in detail), which creates a margin of error and potential for inequitable tip out distribution. Such policies also open the door for tip underreporting, putting the establishment in a precarious tax-reporting position, increasing the likelihood of a dreaded IRS audit. If a restaurant is audited, both restaurant and employee can be fined for any tax violations discovered. While some restaurants may be able to afford the hefty fines and back payments, most employees cannot.

Our aim was to develop an application to help restaurants and restaurant employees with their tip-distribution process. Our goals were to discover pain points and inefficiencies with how restaurants are currently handling this process in order to properly guide feature selection and create our product’s roadmap. 

##Process:
####Interviews, Survey and Awareness:
We started with interviews and observations to get a feel of the industry and get accustomed to terminologies or practices that were commonly used. The goal was to increase our self awareness about the daily life of restaurant employees, get insights, and build empathy towards them. We supplemented interviews and observations by joining social groups on Facebook and Reddit where people from the restaurant community share stories about their workplace activities. 

We originally wanted to deploy contextual inquiries to gain a thorough understanding of the back office checkout processing. It proved difficult to recruit participants for this method because of both the timing and sensitivity of this activity. We shifted to using a survey in order to supplement our qualitative interview findings with quantitative backing. We only received 17 qualified survey results, which was not enough to be statistically significant. However, in the results we did receive, there were some excellent quotes and insights that we used to supplement our qualitative interview findings.

Through conducting several interviews with both front of house and back office employees, we were able to discover that what servers most needed was simplicity and convenience at the end of a night of hard work. They also liked to be able to track their performance. From managers, we found that most were fairly happy with their current systems.

####Competitive Analysis:
Our goal for the competitive analysis was to discover weaknesses in competitor products and opportunities that our product could take advantage of. We used the competitive analysis to further define the requirements for our solution.

We found that, while solutions on the management end were fairly sophisticated, the market lacks a cleanly designed, simple, and useful application for servers to keep track of their own tips and help with their checkouts.

The radar image (page#16 in "Gratify-finalDeck-1.pdf") gives you a glimpse of what the “best” tip-tracking app for servers in the market looks like.

We conducted an in-depth competitive analysis for tip-tracking mobile apps. The user reviews from Google App store and Apple Store helped us determine not only the features that were important to the users but also when and how the servers used these apps
and their pain points. We then determined how each of the top four mobile apps fared on each of these metrics.

Below is an overview of the findings. One of the biggest confirmations was that none of the existing apps facilitated automated tip out calculations or were easy to use.

Also, servers seemed to prefer statistical number (like average, median tip income etc.) over charts while analyzing their earnings and desired a way to track tip income from multiple jobs.  

####Prototype:
Because of the challenges metioned above, while we had set out to design a user-centered, cloud-based system that would simplify the tip out process for all affected parties (servers, bartenders, managers, bookkeepers, and support staff), we finally focused our efforts on creating a mobile prototype for servers. We ended up going with low fidelity prototypes because we didn’t want users that we tested reacting to colors or spacing or fonts. 

####Usability Testing:
We conducted remote usability testing via UserTesting.com and most of the tests went well. Participants were able to complete all assigned tasks, and most tasks were completed without any sign of hesitation. Testers commented that they found it easy, one even writing in follow up questions that it was “very intuitive and simple” and that the interface was free of distractions which was a huge boost!

##Impact:
This project gave us a whole new perspective on the restaurant process of tipping; most of my teammates (including I) were not aware of the complexity and challenges of the process that happens after we leave a restaurant. It was surprising that despite so much technical advancement, the staff of the restaurant still does manual calculations every day at the end of their shift; the tip-tracking apps that did exist were not sufficient or effective.

Once we had developed empathy towards the restaurant community via various UX research methods, we had a much better understanding of the entire landscape and were able to come up with a minimal viable product – a tip tracking mobile app that not only met the basic user’s requirements but was also simple to use. The response we got to our prototype was very positive and served as a confirmation that we were on the right track.

##Next Steps:
To take this project forward, we would plan to continue focusing on the front of house prototype. Because our first round of usability testing validated our initial product design choices and workflow, we want to conduct a second round of prototyping that focuses more on visual styling. The new prototype would be hifidelity, although not yet fully interactive, so it would most likely be built with a combination of tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and inVision. The only other features we would want to test at this point would be the notetaking and multiple jobs features.

Our business strategy would be to take a bottom up approach. As mentioned previously, we decided to focus solely on the front of house product because we felt that the need was most prominent for this segment at this time. We would want to eventually continue working on a back office product, but we think that such work fits into our business strategy after we’ve launched the front of  house product. If we can get traction amongst front of house staff, it will be a much easier sell to back office management if many of their employees are already using our product and can attest to its merits.
